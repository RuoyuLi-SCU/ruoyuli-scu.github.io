    Hi! I am now an undergraduate at Sichuan University (SCU, Chengdu, China) since 2022. My research interests are in artificial intelligence (deep learning) and computer vision.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my academic career, I have participated in many projects and accumulated rich practical experience. I am keen to explore new technologies and share my research results in academic conferences and journals. I look forward to communicating and collaborating with researchers from different backgrounds to jointly promote academic progress.
